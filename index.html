					<h2>Programmer at <a href="http://linkedeconomy.org/">Linked Economy</a></h2>
					<p class="subDetails">April 2015 -present</p>
					<p>Member of the University of Piraeus research team with the colaboration of the Greek National Centre of Scientific Research “Demokritos”, titled Linked Economy.<br>
				The activity of this group is to create connections between different open data, mainly of economic interest that exist on the Internet. My contribution is mainly the Web Scrapping / Harvesting of data and the transformation to machine readable data and in some cases the transferring to a database, which often required the creation of complex schemas.
				<br>
				Apart from the scrapping applications, I was responsible for the creation of various applications that would be imported as a library in other projects of the team. This was something new for me, as I should be in constant contact with the rest of the team to get the desired result. One of those applications (the eLodMessenger as we called it), will be attached to all individual projects of the group, and provide immediate information of exceptions and application failure, or competition of a process, which will then be sent by email to the team members that are interested, or even publish on Twitter, if it is something the team wants to share with the public.
				<br>
				Working with this team gave me a new perspective of how it is to collaborate with a team and follow a specific schedule in order to complete a task and follow deadlines. Although the main gain of this cooperation was the I learned how to create programs that follow some rules to facilitate users and other developers who might read and use my code.
